    <h3>Graphics Mask</h3>

<p><em>A Simple Dynamic Programing Problem</em></p>

<p>This problem essentially asks us to find the number of discrete regions in a grid that has been filled in with some values already. </p>

<p>Dealing with grids as graphs is a very powerful technique, and in this case makes the problem quite easy.</p>

<p>We will define a graph where each node has 4 connections, one each to the node above, left, right and below. 
However, we can represent these connections implicitly within the grid, we need not build out any new data structures. </p>

<p>The structure we will use to represent the grid in grafixMask is a two dimensional array of booleans, 
where regions that we have already determined to be filled in will be set to true, and regions that are unfilled are set to false.</p>

<p>To set up this array given the data from the problem is very simple, and looks something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">bool fill[600][400];
initialize fills to false;

foreach rectangle in Rectangles
    set from (rectangle.left, rectangle.top) to (rectangle.right, retangle.bottom) to true
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we have an initialized connectivity grid. When we want to move from grid position (x, y) we can either move up, down, left or right. When we want to move up for example, we simply check the grid position in (x, y-1) to see if it is true or false. If the grid position is false, we can move there, if it is true, we cannot.</p>

<p>Now we need to determine the area of each region that is left. We don&#39;t want to count regions twice, or pixels twice either, so what we will do is set fill[x][y] to true when we visit the node at (x, y). This will allow us to perform a Depth-First search to visit all of the nodes in a connected region and never visit any node twice, which is exactly what the problem wants us to do! So our loop after setting everything up will be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">int[] result;

for x = 0 to 599
    for y = 0 to 399
        if (fill[x][y] == false)
            result.addToBack(doFill(x,y));
</code></pre></div>
<p>All this code does is check if we have not already filled in the position at (x, y) and then calls doFill() to fill in that region. At this point we have a choice, we can define doFill recursively (which is usually the quickest and easiest way to do a depth first search), or we can define it explicitly using the built in stack classes. I will cover the recursive method first, but we will soon see for this problem there are some serious issues with the recursive method.</p>

<p>We will now define doFill to return the size of the connected area and the start position of the area:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">int doFill(int x, int y) {

    // Check to ensure that we are within the bounds of the grid, if not, return 0
    if (x &lt; 0 || x &gt;= 600) return 0;

    // Similar check for y
    if (y &lt; 0 || y &gt;= 400) return 0;

    // Check that we haven&#39;t already visited this position, as we don&#39;t want to count it twice
    if (fill[x][y]) return 0;

    // Record that we have visited this node
    fill[x][y] = true;

    // Now we know that we have at least one empty square, then we will recursively attempt to
    // visit every node adjacent to this node, and add those results together to return.
    return 1 + doFill(x - 1, y) + doFill(x + 1, y) + doFill(x, y + 1) + doFill(x, y - 1);
}
</code></pre></div>
