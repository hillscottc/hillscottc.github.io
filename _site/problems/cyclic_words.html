    <h1>Cyclic Words</h1>

    <h2>Cyclic Words</h2>

<p>TopCoder problem &quot;CyclicWords&quot; used in SRM 358 (Division II Level One)</p>

<p>Problem Statement
We can think of a cyclic word as a word written in a circle. To represent a cyclic word, we choose an arbitrary starting position and read the characters in clockwise order. So, &quot;picture&quot; and &quot;turepic&quot; are representations for the same cyclic word.</p>

<p>You are given a String[] words, each element of which is a representation of a cyclic word. Return the number of different cyclic words that are represented.</p>

<p>Definition</p>

<p>Class:     CyclicWords
Method:     differentCW
Parameters:     String[]
Returns:     int
Method signature:     int differentCW(String[] words)
(be sure your method is public)</p>

<p>Constraints
- words will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
- Each element of words will contain between 1 and 50 lowercase letters (&#39;a&#39;-&#39;z&#39;), inclusive.</p>
