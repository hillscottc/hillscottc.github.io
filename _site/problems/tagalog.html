    <h2>Tagalog Dictionary</h2>

<p>TopCoder problem &quot;TagalogDictionary&quot; used in SRM 342 (Division I Level One , Division II Level Two)</p>

<p>Problem Statement</p>

<p>In the first half of the 20th century, around the time that Tagalog became the national language of the Philippines, a standardized alphabet was introduced to be used in Tagalog school books (since then, the national language has changed to a hybrid &quot;Pilipino&quot; language, as Tagalog is only one of several major languages spoken in the Philippines).
Tagalog&#39;s 20-letter alphabet is as follows:
a b k d e g h i l m n ng o p r s t u w y
Note that not all letters used in English are present, &#39;k&#39; is the third letter, and &#39;ng&#39; is a single letter that comes between &#39;n&#39; and &#39;o&#39;.
You are compiling a Tagalog dictionary, and for people to be able to find words in it, the words need to be sorted in alphabetical order with reference to the Tagalog alphabet. Given a list of Tagalog words as a String[], return the same list in Tagalog alphabetical order.</p>
