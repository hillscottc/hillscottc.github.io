Another classic problem that we can use to illustrate a second common graph algorithm is called the *knight’s tour*. The knight’s tour puzzle is played on a chess board with a single chess piece, the knight. The object of the puzzle is to find a sequence of moves that allow the knight to visit every square on the board exactly once. One such sequence is called a tour. A graph search is one of the easiest to solve this. Once again we will solve the problem using two main steps:

- Represent the legal moves of a knight on a chessboard as a graph.
- Use a graph algorithm to find a path of length *rows x columns - 1* where every vertex on the graph is visited exactly once.

### Building the Knight’s Tour Graph

To represent the knight’s tour problem as a graph we will use the following two ideas: 

- Each square on the board is a node, and 
- each legal move is an edge.

![Legal knight moves][fig_1]

To build the full graph for an n-by-n board we can use the Python function shown in Listing 1. The `knightGraph` function makes one pass over the entire board. At each square on the board the `knightGraph` function calls a helper, `genLegalMoves`, to create a list of legal moves for that position on the board. All legal moves are then converted into edges in the graph. Another helper function `posToNodeId` converts a location on the board in terms of a row and a column into a linear vertex number similar to the vertex numbers shown in the img above.

**Listing 1**

    from pythonds.graphs import Graph

    def knightGraph(bdSize):
        ktGraph = Graph()
        for row in range(bdSize):
           for col in range(bdSize):
               nodeId = posToNodeId(row,col,bdSize)
               newPositions = genLegalMoves(row,col,bdSize)
               for e in newPositions:
                   nid = posToNodeId(e[0],e[1],bdSize)
                   ktGraph.addEdge(nodeId,nid)
        return ktGraph


The `genLegalMoves` function (Listing 2) takes the position of the knight on the board and generates each of the eight possible moves. The `legalCoord` helper function (Listing 2) makes sure that a particular move that is generated is still on the board.

**Listing 2**

    def genLegalMoves(x,y,bdSize):
        newMoves = []
        moveOffsets = [(-1,-2),(-1,2),(-2,-1),(-2,1),
                       ( 1,-2),( 1,2),( 2,-1),( 2,1)]
        for i in moveOffsets:
            newX = x + i[0]
            newY = y + i[1]
            if legalCoord(newX,bdSize) and \
                            legalCoord(newY,bdSize):
                newMoves.append((newX,newY))
        return newMoves

    def legalCoord(x,bdSize):
        if x >= 0 and x < bdSize:
            return True
        else:
            return False


Implementing Knight’s Tour¶The search algorithm we will use to solve the knight’s tour problem is called **depth first search (DFS)**. Whereas the breadth first search algorithm discussed in the previous section builds a search tree one level at a time, a depth first search creates a search tree by exploring one branch of the tree as deeply as possible. In this section we will look at two algorithms that implement a depth first search. The first algorithm we will look at directly solves the knight’s tour problem by explicitly forbidding a node to be visited more than once. The second implementation is more general, but allows nodes to be visited more than once as the tree is constructed. The second version is used in subsequent sections to develop additional graph algorithms.

The depth first exploration of the graph is exactly what we need in order to find a path that has exactly 63 edges. We will see that when the depth first search algorithm finds a dead end (a place in the graph where there are no more moves possible) it backs up the tree to the next deepest vertex that allows it to make a legal move.

The `knightTour` function takes four parameters: `n`, the current depth in the search tree; `path`, a list of vertices visited up to this point; `u`, the vertex in the graph we wish to explore; and `limit` the number of nodes in the path. The `knightTour` function is recursive. When the `knightTour` function is called, it first checks the base case condition. If we have a path that contains 64 vertices, we return from `knightTour` with a status of True, indicating that we have found a successful tour. If the path is not long enough we continue to explore one level deeper by choosing a new vertex to explore and calling knightTour recursively for that vertex.

DFS also uses colors to keep track of which vertices in the graph have been visited. Unvisited vertices are colored white, and visited vertices are colored gray. If all neighbors of a particular vertex have been explored and we have not yet reached our goal length of 64 vertices, we have reached a dead end. When we reach a dead end we must backtrack. Backtracking happens when we return from knightTour with a status of False. In the breadth first search we used a queue to keep track of which vertex to visit next. Since depth first search is recursive, we are implicitly using a stack to help us with our backtracking. When we return from a call to knightTour with a status of False, in line 11, we remain inside the while loop and look at the next vertex in nbrList.

**Listing 3**

    from pythonds.graphs import Graph, Vertex
    def knightTour(n,path,u,limit):
            u.setColor('gray')
            path.append(u)
            if n < limit:
                nbrList = list(u.getConnections())
                i = 0
                done = False
                while i < len(nbrList) and not done:
                    if nbrList[i].getColor() == 'white':
                        done = knightTour(n+1, path, nbrList[i], limit)
                    i = i + 1
                if not done:  # prepare to backtrack
                    path.pop()
                    u.setColor('white')
            else:
                done = True
            return done

Let’s look at a simple example of knightTour in action. You can refer to the figures below to follow the steps of the search. For this example we will assume that the call to the getConnections method on line 6 orders the nodes in alphabetical order. We begin by calling knightTour(0,path,A,6)
knightTour starts with node A Figure 3. The nodes adjacent to A are B and D. Since B is before D alphabetically, DFS selects B to expand next as shown in Figure 4. Exploring B happens when knightTour is called recursively. B is adjacent to C and D, so knightTour elects to explore C next. However, as you can see in Figure 5 node C is a dead end with no adjacent white nodes. At this point we change the color of node C back to white. The call to knightTour returns a value of False. The return from the recursive call effectively backtracks the search to vertex B (see Figure 6). The next vertex on the list to explore is vertex D, so knightTour makes a recursive call moving to node D (see Figure 7). From vertex D on, knightTour can continue to make recursive calls until we get to node C again (see Figure 8, Figure 9, and Figure 10). However, this time when we get to node C the test n < limit fails so we know that we have exhausted all the nodes in the graph. At this point we can return True to indicate that we have made a successful tour of the graph. When we return the list, path has the values `[A, B, D, E, F, C]`, which is the the order we need to traverse the graph to visit each node exactly once.

### Knight’s Tour Analysis

There is one last interesting topic regarding the knight’s tour problem, then we will move on to the general version of the depth first search. The topic is performance. In particular, knightTour is very sensitive to the method you use to select the next vertex to visit. For example, on a five-by-five board you can produce a path in about 1.5 seconds on a reasonably fast computer. But what happens if you try an eight-by-eight board? In this case, depending on the speed of your computer, you may have to wait up to a half hour to get the results! The reason for this is that the knight’s tour problem as we have implemented it so far is an exponential algorithm of size , where N is the number of squares on the chess board, and k is a small constant. Figure 12 can help us visualize why this is so. The root of the tree represents the starting point of the search. From there the algorithm generates and checks each of the possible moves the knight can make. As we have noted before the number of moves possible depends on the position of the knight on the board. In the corners there are only two legal moves, on the squares adjacent to the corners there are three and in the middle of the board there are eight. Figure 13 shows the number of moves possible for each position on a board. At the next level of the tree there are once again between 2 and 8 possible next moves from the position we are currently exploring. The number of possible positions to examine corresponds to the number of nodes in the search tree.


![Figure 12: A Search Tree for the Knight’s Tour][fig_12]
![Figure 13: Number of Possible Moves for Each Square][fig_13]


The important thing to note is that this algorithm is exponential: `k^N+1 - 1`, where `k` is the average branching factor for the board. 

Luckily there is a way to speed it up. In the listing below we show the code that speeds up the `knightTour`. This function (see Listing 4), called `orderbyAvail` will be used in place of the call to `u.getConnections` in the code previously shown above. The critical line in the `orderByAvail` function is line 10. This line ensures that we select the vertex to go next that has the fewest available moves. You might think this is really counter productive; why not select the node that has the most available moves? You can try that approach easily by running the program yourself and inserting the line `resList.reverse()` right after the sort.

The problem with using the vertex with the most available moves as your next vertex on the path is that it tends to have the knight visit the middle squares early on in the tour. When this happens it is easy for the knight to get stranded on one side of the board where it cannot reach unvisited squares on the other side of the board. On the other hand, visiting the squares with the fewest available moves first pushes the knight to visit the squares around the edges of the board first. This ensures that the knight will visit the hard-to-reach corners early and can use the middle squares to hop across the board only when necessary. Utilizing this kind of knowledge to speed up an algorithm is called a heuristic. Humans use heuristics every day to help make decisions, heuristic searches are often used in the field of artificial intelligence. This particular heuristic is called Warnsdorff’s algorithm, named after H. C. Warnsdorff who published his idea in 1823.

**Listing 4**

    def orderByAvail(n):
        resList = []
        for v in n.getConnections():
            if v.getColor() == 'white':
                c = 0
                for w in v.getConnections():
                    if w.getColor() == 'white':
                        c = c + 1
                resList.append((c,v))
        resList.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        return [y[1] for y in resList]


### General Depth First Search

The knight’s tour is a special case of a depth first search where the goal is to create the deepest depth first tree, without any branches. The more general depth first search is actually easier. Its goal is to search as deeply as possible, connecting as many nodes in the graph as possible and branching where necessary.

It is even possible that a depth first search will create more than one tree. When the depth first search algorithm creates a group of trees we call this a **depth first forest**. As with the breadth first search our depth first search makes use of predecessor links to construct the tree. In addition, the depth first search will make use of two additional instance variables in the Vertex class. The new instance variables are the discovery and finish times. The discovery time tracks the number of steps in the algorithm before a vertex is first encountered. The finish time is the number of steps in the algorithm before a vertex is colored black. As we will see after looking at the algorithm, the discovery and finish times of the nodes provide some interesting properties we can use in later algorithms.

The code for our depth first search is shown in Listing 5. Since the two functions `dfs` and its helper `dfsvisit` use a variable to keep track of the time across calls to dfsvisit we chose to implement the code as methods of a class that inherits from the `Graph` class. This implementation extends the graph class by adding a `time` instance variable and the two methods `dfs` and `dfsvisit`. Looking at line 11 you will notice that the dfs method iterates over all of the vertices in the graph calling dfsvisit on the nodes that are white. The reason we iterate over all the nodes, rather than simply searching from a chosen starting node, is to make sure that all nodes in the graph are considered and that no vertices are left out of the depth first forest. It may look unusual to see the statement `for aVertex in self`, but remember that in this case `self` is an instance of the DFSGraph class, and iterating over all the vertices in an instance of a graph is a natural thing to do.

**Listing 5**

    from pythonds.graphs import Graph
    class DFSGraph(Graph):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.time = 0

        def dfs(self):
            for aVertex in self:
                aVertex.setColor('white')
                aVertex.setPred(-1)
            for aVertex in self:
                if aVertex.getColor() == 'white':
                    self.dfsvisit(aVertex)

        def dfsvisit(self,startVertex):
            startVertex.setColor('gray')
            self.time += 1
            startVertex.setDiscovery(self.time)
            for nextVertex in startVertex.getConnections():
                if nextVertex.getColor() == 'white':
                    nextVertex.setPred(startVertex)
                    self.dfsvisit(nextVertex)
            startVertex.setColor('black')
            self.time += 1
            startVertex.setFinish(self.time)


Although our implementation of bfs was only interested in considering nodes for which there was a path leading back to the start, it is possible to create a breadth first forest that represents the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in the graph. We leave this as an exercise. In our next two algorithms we will see why keeping track of the depth first forest is important.

The dfsvisit method starts with a single vertex called startVertex and explores all of the neighboring white vertices as deeply as possible. If you look carefully at the code for dfsvisit and compare it to breadth first search, what you should notice is that the dfsvisit algorithm is almost identical to bfs except that on the last line of the inner for loop, dfsvisit calls itself recursively to continue the search at a deeper level, whereas bfs adds the node to a queue for later exploration. It is interesting to note that where bfs uses a queue, dfsvisit uses a stack. You don’t see a stack in the code, but it is implicit in the recursive call to dfsvisit.

The following sequence of figures illustrates the depth first search algorithm in action for a small graph. In these figures, the dotted lines indicate edges that are checked, but the node at the other end of the edge has already been added to the depth first tree. In the code this test is done by checking that the color of the other node is non-white.

The search begins at vertex A of the graph (Figure 14). Since all of the vertices are white at the beginning of the search the algorithm visits vertex A. The first step in visiting a vertex is to set the color to gray, which indicates that the vertex is being explored and the discovery time is set to 1. Since vertex A has two adjacent vertices (B, D) each of those need to be visited as well. We’ll make the arbitrary decision that we will visit the adjacent vertices in alphabetical order.

Vertex B is visited next (Figure 15), so its color is set to gray and its discovery time is set to 2. Vertex B is also adjacent to two other nodes (C, D) so we will follow the alphabetical order and visit node C next.

Visiting vertex C (Figure 16) brings us to the end of one branch of the tree. After coloring the node gray and setting its discovery time to 3, the algorithm also determines that there are no adjacent vertices to C. This means that we are done exploring node C and so we can color the vertex black, and set the finish time to 4. You can see the state of our search at this point in Figure 17.

Since vertex C was the end of one branch we now return to vertex B and continue exploring the nodes adjacent to B. The only additional vertex to explore from B is D, so we can now visit D (Figure 18) and continue our search from vertex D. Vertex D quickly leads us to vertex E (Figure 19). Vertex E has two adjacent vertices, B and F. Normally we would explore these adjacent vertices alphabetically, but since B is already colored gray the algorithm recognizes that it should not visit B since doing so would put the algorithm in a loop! So exploration continues with the next vertex in the list, namely F (Figure 20).

Vertex F has only one adjacent vertex, C, but since C is colored black there is nothing else to explore, and the algorithm has reached the end of another branch. From here on, you will see in Figure 21 thru Figure 25  that the algorithm works its way back to the first node, setting finish times and coloring vertices black.

![Figure 24-26: Constructing the Depth First Search Tree][fig_23-26]


The starting and finishing times for each node display a property called the parenthesis property. This property means that all the children of a particular node in the depth first tree have a later discovery time and an earlier finish time than their parent. Figure 26 shows the tree constructed by the depth first search algorithm.

### Depth First Search Analysis

The general running time for depth first search is as follows. The loops in dfs both run in O(V), not counting what happens in dfsvisit, since they are executed once for each vertex in the graph. In dfsvisit the loop is executed once for each edge in the adjacency list of the current vertex. Since dfsvisit is only called recursively if the vertex is white, the loop will execute a maximum of once for every edge in the graph or O(E). So, the total time for depth first search is O(V + E).
