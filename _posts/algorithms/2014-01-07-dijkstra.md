Dijkstra essentially is a breadth-first traversal using a *heap* instead of a *queue*. The heap is sorted putting lowest cost nodes on top. 

Finds best path in `O(m * log(n))` where `n`is the number of vertices, and `m` is the number of edges in the graph.

A *heap*'s nice properties:
  - Insert/remove the top el takes `O(log n)`, where `n` is num elems in the heap. 
  - Getting the top value takes `O(1)`


Dijkstra pseudocode:

    void dijkstra(node start) {
        priorityQueue s;
        s.add(start);
        while (s.empty() == false) {
            top = s.top();
            s.pop();
            mark top as visited;
            check for termination condition (have we reached the target node?)
            add all of top's unvisited neighbors to the stack.
        }
    }


Here's a working imp, modified from [this recipe](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577343-dijkstras-algorithm-for-shortest-paths/).
